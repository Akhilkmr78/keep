# keep
An app developed to organize the day-to-day notes of a user, with custom data and simple sign-up/sign-in flow. Developed on the basis of a popular google app Google-keep, I've tried to replicate the functionality of the original app with frontend tools such as Vue, Vuetify and Firebase for handling the data and auth.
