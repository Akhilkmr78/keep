# keep
![alt text](https://github.com/Akhilkmr78/keep/blob/main/src/assets/keep-mobile-version.png?raw=true)

An app developed to organize the day-to-day notes of a user, with custom data and simple sign-up/sign-in flow. Developed on the basis of a popular google app Google-keep, I've tried to replicate the functionality of the original app with frontend tools such as Vue, Vuetify and Firebase for handling the data and auth.

#install all dependencies
npm install

#serve app with localhost: 8080
npm run serve

#build app for production
npm run build
```
